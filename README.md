# valentine-day-heart
This Python program uses nested list comprehensions to generate a visual pattern resembling a heart shape, with the name of your beloved one embedded inside.

The condition inside the if statement:
((x∗0.05)2+(y∗0.1)2−1)3−(x∗0.05)2∗(y∗0.1)3≤0
is a well-known implicit equation for a heart shape.
